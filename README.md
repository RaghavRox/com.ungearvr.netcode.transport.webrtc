# com.ungearvr.netcode.transport.webrtc
This project is recently started and currently the plan of this project is to implement a transport layer using webrtc. Also initially the signalling is done through websockets using websocket sharp library but in the future i plan to seperate transport layer and signalling part so that anyone can use their own signalling.
